# This Repository contains simple python script that I have made to help me when I was in college

## 1. **converter.py**

this script is used to otomatically convert every file in a folder that use .dta as an extention and convert them into .csv format

The only input that you need is your **folder path** which contains all of your .dta files that you want to convert


## 2. **roman_numeral.py**
this script is actually made for fun, you take number as an input and this script will convert the number into their roman numerical value.
The problem from this script is that : it cannot take a value grater than 3999, because I'm having trouble printing the vbar and xbar as a string in python
